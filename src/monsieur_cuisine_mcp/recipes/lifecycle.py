        review (status "pending"); it becomes publicly visible only after the

        published only to the user's own account, with no editorial review.

    between public and private (pending <-> private-publish are both allowed).

    "not complete" error is raised listing what is missing): it needs a cover
    photo, complexity, categories, a serving size, at least one ingredient, and
    a non-empty title on every step and ingredient group. Build the draft with
    create_recipe first, then publish it here.

    NOTE: a published recipe cannot be turned back into a draft - the platform
