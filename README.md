# Unofficial Monsieur Cuisine MCP

An unofficial [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server (built with
[FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)) that lets an AI assistant search,
read, **create**, edit, and publish recipes on the Monsieur Cuisine service
(Lidl's Monsieur Cuisine / LidlMix) using your own account.

> [!WARNING]
> **This is a vibe-coded prototype.** The whole thing was built conversationally,
> end to end. It works and it's been tested against a real account — but treat it
> as a proof-of-concept, not production-grade code. There are no unit tests, the
> API is reverse-engineered from the web app (so it can break any time Lidl
> changes something), and every "authoring" tool writes to your **real** account.
> Have fun with it, but don't build anything important on top of it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Monsieur Cuisine Smart (MC3.0) only.** The recipe-authoring features (device
> programs and automatic step modes) are built and tested exclusively for the
> Monsieur Cuisine **Smart** (MC3.0). Other models expose a different, smaller
> program set that isn't supported here, so creating/editing recipes for them may
> fail or produce wrong steps.

## What it does

Monsieur Cuisine has no official API. This server talks to the same endpoints the
web app uses — the public recipe API, plus the site's session-authenticated
proxy for your own recipes and favorites — and exposes them as clean MCP tools.
Point any MCP-capable assistant at it and you can say things like *"build me a
450-kcal high-protein lunch for two and save it privately"* and it'll actually do
it.

## Cool things to try

These are just natural-language prompts to your assistant — it picks the tools.

**🎯 Hit an exact calorie & macro target.**
> "Create a private recipe for a high-protein lunch bowl at about 450 kcal with
> 40 g protein, 30 g carbs and 15 g fat, 2 servings. Add realistic ingredient
> amounts and step-by-step Monsieur Cuisine smart instructions, then publish it
> privately."

**🧊 Cook from whatever's in the fridge.**
> "I've got chicken thighs, a zucchini, half an onion, garlic and some rice.
> Find recipes I can make on my Monsieur Cuisine — and if nothing fits, draft a
> new one that uses them and set the device programs for each step."

**⚖️ Rescale servings.**
> "Take my 'Zupa jarzynowa' recipe and change it from 3 servings to 6 — scale the
> ingredient amounts accordingly and bump the times if it needs it."

**🥗 Nutrition-tune an existing recipe.**
> "Edit my pancake recipe to bring it down to ~300 kcal per serving and raise
> protein to 20 g, keeping everything else the same."

**📸 Recipe with a cover photo, ready to publish.**
> "Create a draft for oatmeal with berries, attach `~/photos/oatmeal.jpg` as the
> cover, fill in nutrients and steps, then publish it privately."

**🧹 Tidy up.**
> "List all my recipes, publish the two soup drafts privately, and delete the
> empty test ones."

## Requirements

- **Python ≥ 3.10** (developed on 3.12)
- [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management
- A real **Monsieur Cuisine / Lidl account** (login happens in a real browser)
- A **Monsieur Cuisine Smart (MC3.0)** — the recipe-authoring features target
  this model only
- Dependencies (installed via `uv sync`): `fastmcp`, `httpx`, `playwright`

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 2. Install the browser used for the one-time login (once)
uv run playwright install chromium

# 3. Log in — a real browser window opens; sign in normally (CAPTCHA/2FA included)
uv run monsieur-cuisine-mcp-login
```

Lidl's login (`accounts.lidl.com`) is interactive and CAPTCHA-protected, so
there's no headless login — you log in **manually** in the browser window that
opens. Once the session is established, the cookies are saved to
`~/.monsieur-cuisine-mcp/storage_state.json` and reused until they expire.
Re-run the login command whenever the session lapses.

The login uses your installed **Google Chrome** when it's available (falling
back to the bundled Chromium) and keeps its own browser profile in
`~/.monsieur-cuisine-mcp/browser-profile`, so repeat logins look like the same
returning device. If a login fails, it writes a timestamped trace — navigations,
request statuses, console errors — to `~/.monsieur-cuisine-mcp/last-login.log`.
No passwords and no request/response bodies are ever recorded.

### Run the server

```bash
uv run monsieur-cuisine-mcp        # starts the MCP server over stdio
```

### Connect it to an MCP client

Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add monsieur-cuisine -- uv run --directory /path/to/Unofficial-Monsieur-Cuisine-MCP monsieur-cuisine-mcp
```

…or the generic JSON config most MCP clients understand:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "monsieur-cuisine": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/Unofficial-Monsieur-Cuisine-MCP", "monsieur-cuisine-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Verbose logs: set `MC_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` or pass `--debug` to either command.

## Tools

Fourteen tools, grouped by what they touch.

### Discover & read — public, no login needed

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `search_recipes` | Search the public catalog with rich filters: category, complexity, duration, rating, device type, and even nutrient **ranges** (kcal / protein / carbs / fat). |
| `list_recipe_filters` | List the valid filter option ids (categories, complexity, …) for a language — feed these into `search_recipes`. |
| `get_recipe` | Full details for a recipe by id: ingredients, per-serving steps, and nutrients. Also reads **your own** drafts/private recipes when you're logged in. |

### Your account — login required

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_my_recipes` | Your own authored recipes, filterable by status (draft / in-review / private / published). |
| `list_favorite_recipes` | Your bookmarked recipes. |
| `add_favorite_recipe` / `remove_favorite_recipe` | Bookmark or un-bookmark a recipe. |
| `search_ingredients` | Search the ingredient database (returns the ingredient ids used to link steps to real ingredients). |

### Author recipes — login required

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_recipe_creation_options` | Valid complexity/category/unit/device ids **plus** the full device-program catalog (customized, steaming, sous-vide, cooking eggs, …). |
| `create_recipe` | Create a draft: title, description, servings, prep/ready times, whole-number nutrients, ingredient groups, steps with automatic device programs, and an optional cover photo. |
| `edit_recipe` | Change any fields of one of your recipes — only what you pass is updated, everything else is preserved. |
| `publish_recipe` | Publish a draft **privately**, or submit it for **public** editorial review. Also flips an already-published recipe between private and public. |
| `delete_recipe` | Move one of your recipes to trash (works from any status). |
| `restore_recipe` | Bring a trashed recipe back as a draft (undo a delete). |

## How it works

- **Public API** (`mc-api.tecpal.com`) — search, filters, and public recipe
  details. No auth.
- **Session proxy** (`/proxy-api`) — everything tied to your account (favorites,
  your own recipes, create/edit/publish/delete), authenticated with the browser
  cookies from the manual login.
- **WordPress admin-ajax** — the recipe-creation "guide" (valid categories,
  units, devices).

The code lives in a small package split by concern: `client` (the authenticated
proxy call + error handling), `search`, `favorites`, `ingredients`, `nutrients`,
`media` (cover-photo upload), `payloads` (recipe read→write mapping), `devices`
(the device-program catalog and step builder), `lifecycle` (status changes +
listing), and `authoring` (create/edit).

## Good to know / limitations

- **It's your real account.** Authoring tools create, change, publish, and trash
  real recipes. `delete_recipe` moves a recipe to trash — it vanishes from the
  site (which has **no trash view or restore button**, so treat it as permanent
  there), but the data is kept and `restore_recipe` can bring it back as a draft.
  There's no hard-delete, so trashed recipes linger server-side forever.
- **Nutrients must be whole numbers** — fractional values are rounded.
- **Every step needs a title** and **every ingredient group needs a name** to be
  publishable; the tools auto-fill sensible defaults ("Step 1", "General
  Ingredients") so drafts stay publishable.
- **Publishing is a one-way street away from "draft".** A published recipe can be
  switched between private and public, or deleted — but it **cannot be reverted
  to a draft** (the platform forbids it).
- **Public vs. private publish.** "Private" is instant; "public" submits the
  recipe for Monsieur Cuisine's editorial review and only goes live after they
  approve it.
- **Some categories aren't assignable.** `list_recipe_creation_options` returns a
  few categories the create API rejects; if you hit `Invalid category`, pick a
  different one.
- **Rate limiting.** Bursts of write calls can get temporarily throttled — space
  them out.
